# User generated Custom map
https://cg-map.herokuapp.com/

The aims of this project is to develop a web application that allows users to create maps
and integrate them into their applications. A user will be able to create their
own map by drawing on OSM or Google satellite map tiles and they will have
the option to share their maps with third party via URL. Users will have the
possibility to place markers, draw buildings and streets. They will be able to
edit the map markers anytime after the maps have been created.
